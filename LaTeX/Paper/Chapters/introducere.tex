\section{Introduction}\label{cap:intro}

The assignment for this project, required the usage of one benchmark and two tools for which to analyze upon. For the purpose of our project, we have decided to utilize the ACAS-Xu benchmark\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ChristopherBrix/vnncomp2023_benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/acasxu}}, along with the tools Alpha Beta Crown\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN}} and Nnenum \footnote{\url{https://github.com/stanleybak/nnenum}}.
In the following sections we will see what the selected benchmark represents (section \ref{sect:acasxu}), the challenges the tools presented (section \ref{chap:ch3}), as well as how ACAS-Xu scored with the chosen tools based on the VNN COMP 2023 competition (section \ref{chap:ch4}).
