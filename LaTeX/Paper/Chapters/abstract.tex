This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the Alpha Beta Crown and Nnenum verification tools with the ACAS-Xu benchmark, which is critical for ensuring the safety of unmanned aircraft systems by issuing turn rate advisories. The project aimed to replicate findings from the VNN-COMP 2023 competition, focusing on the verification of neural networks for the ACAS-Xu system. The dataset uses parameters from sensor measurements across 45 deep neural networks, with the verification targeting 10 specific properties. The results indicated that out of 186 instances, 139 were safe, and 47 unsafe, achieving an accuracy of approximately 74.73\%. Besides the results, the study showcases the challenges of the tools setup.
