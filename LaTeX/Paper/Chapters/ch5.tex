\section{Conclusions}
\label{chap:ch5}

This study presents the results of the evaluation of state of the art verification methods on the ACAS-Xu benchmark. The aim was to replicate the results from the VNN-COMP 2023\cite{brix2023fourth}  competition with the usage of alpha-beta-CROWN and nnenum. The findings revealed that out of 186 instances examined, 47 were identified as unsafe. It's worth noting a significant difference in the results when running alpha-beta-CROWN compared to the competition, as there were no penalties. The instance that did result in a penalty was classified as unsafe. The verification process used the same parameters as those used in the competition, with the source filed obtained directly from the official GitHub repository \footnote{\url{https://github.com/ChristopherBrix/vnncomp2023_benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/acasxu}}.
